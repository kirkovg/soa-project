# SOA Book API
Project done as a proof of concept API with microservice architecture

Course: Service Oriented Architecture @ [FCSE](https://www.finki.ukim.mk)

## Short description

The business logic of the API will consist of mostly search operations
on various categories of books like name, authors, year, publication date etc.

## Instructions to run on server
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the newly created folder `cd soa-project`
3. Stop any running containers you might have `docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)`
4. If you haven't built the docker images for the microservices, you can do so by running the bash script `bash build_docker_images.sh`.
5. Once all the images have been built successfully, run the JHipster Registry `docker-compose -f jhipster-registry.yml up`
6. Navigate to `soa-project/docker-compose`. This is where the central configuration file `docker-compose.yml` is and from here you can run all the microservices at once `docker-compose up -d`.
7. Check if all processes are running correctly with `docker ps` (you should see a process for each microservice container).

## Application architecture

The functionalities of searching through various criteria are separated
in different microservices (see microservice list below.) to balance the strain in case of heavy load.
While searching through the book data the requests will mostly depend on the
User Preferences microservice which will hold the the data about what the user likes
(favorite genres, authors etc.).
There will be a second operation which will be supported by the Random Search microservice,
which is going to randomise searches for the user based on the book search criteria.
The User microservice will be responsible for the user management of the application.
The authentication will be available through the Zuul (Edge) microservice.
For load balancing we will use traefik, Eureka as a service registry and custom API Gateway
as a central unification point of the microservices.
The initial database records will be filled with data scraped from the web.
